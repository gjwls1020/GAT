By the grace of Allah, the soldiers of the Khilafah repulsed attacks by the Rafidi army and its militias with crusader air support near Kokajli, Shahrazad, and Jalyukhan villages. Four knights of shahadah (may Allah accept them) lied in wait for them and blew up their explosive-laden vehicles amid the apostate groups. Clashes followed with diverse weaponry, resulting in killing and wounding dozens of them, and destroying some of their military vehicles, including a hummer.
