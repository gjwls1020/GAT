Following an attempt carried out by the the Rafidi SWAT militia to infilitrate into the Samah neighborhood east of Mosul, Abu Sa'd al-Jazrawi and Abu Dujanah al-Mosuli (may Allah accept them) detonated their explosive-laden vehicles amid the groups of murtaddin on the edges of the neighborhood. They succeeded in killing more than 30 murtaddin and wounding others, as well as destroying a bulldozer and six hummers, in addition to two others being damaged. This was followed by  the soldiers of the Khilafah attacking those who survived the two blasts, as the murtaddin fled in defeat afterwards. Meanwhile the Crusader coalition aircraft mistakenly targeted a house on the outskirts of the city, which was occupied by the murtaddin. All praise is due to Allah.
