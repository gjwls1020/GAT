By Allah's grace, and within the epic battles which the soldiers of the Khilafah are engaged in on the honorable land of Ninawa wilayah, the istishhadi brother Abu Jabir al-Misri (may Allah accept him) detonated his explosive-laden vehicle on a gathering of Rafidi army and militias in #Shahrazad village southeast of Ninawa. He succeeded in killing approx. 15 murtaddin and wounding others, as well as destroying four military vehicles and damaging a BMP vehicle. This was followed by clashes during which various types of weapons were used, in conjunction with targeting their positions with rocket-propelled grenades, leading to several murtaddin being killed and wounded, as well as an Abrams tank and two bulldozers being destroyed, in addition to two barracks being set on fire. All praise is due to Allah.
