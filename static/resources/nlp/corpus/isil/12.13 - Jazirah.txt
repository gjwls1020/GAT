By Allah’s grace and success, a number of soldiers of the Khilafah raided Rafidi Mobilization groups in Tal Aska’ village west of Tal’afar using various types of weapons. Fierce clashes took place, during which our istishhadi brother Abu ‘Aishah al-’Iraqi (may Allah accept him) detonated his explosive vehicle amid their gatherings, killing and injuring dozens of them, in addition to destroying several military vehicles. In a related context, the istishhadi brothers Abu Rawahah al-Maslawi and Abu ‘Abdir-Rahman al-Halabi (may Allah accept them) set out and detonated their explosive vehicles on Rafidi Mobilization gatherings attempting to advance towards Shawah village south of Tal’afar. They succeeded in killing and wounding approximately 24 murtaddin, in addition to destroying several military vehicles, all praise is due to Allah.
