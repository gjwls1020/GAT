Two Istishhadi Operation and Miscellaneous Attacks on the Gatherings of #Rafida Northwest of #TalAbtah Town. By Allah's success, Abu 'Abdillah ash-Shishani and Khattab ash-Shishani (may Allah accept them) set out and detonated their explosive vehicles successively amid the gatherings of the #Rafidi Mobilization during their failed attempt to advance towards the Faisaliyyah village north of Tal 'Abtah town. The first blast resulted in many murtaddin being killed and wounded as well as military vehicles being destroyed. The second operation resulted in the killing of approximately 20 murtaddin as well as destroying 4 vehicles including a Cougar. Meanwhile, a T-72 tank was destroyed in the Salihiyyah village with RPGs, in addition to another T-72 tank and 2 BMPs in the village of Faisaliyyah, and all praise is due to Allah.
