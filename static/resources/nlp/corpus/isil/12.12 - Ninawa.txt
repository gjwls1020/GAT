By Allah's grace, 3 of the knights of shahadah set out with their explosive vehicles towards gatherings of the Rafidi Mobilization west and south of Tal'afar. Our brother Abul-Bara' al-Halabi (may Allah accpt him) detonated his explosive vehicle amid the groups of murtaddinin the village of Abu Sanam south of Tal'afar. The other istishhadis detonated their explosive vehicles on the murtaddin in the villages of 'Amudiyyah and Tal Aska' west of the town. The operations resulted in dozens of murtaddin being killed and wounded, in addition to 5 Humvees and several military vehicles being destroyed. Meanwhile, an Abrams tank was disabled as well as a Humvee and a BMP were destroyed with guided missiles near the villages of 'Amudiyyah and Abu Sanam. Likewise, a number of murtaddin were killed after being trapped in a minefield near Tal Aska' village, all praise is due to Allah.
