With intensified air cover and artillery support, the apostates attempted to advance from two axes towards the area of #Hamdaniyyah, southeast of #Mosul. Four knights of martyrdom, Abul-Bara al-Iraqi, Abu Harith al-Iraqi, Abu Talib al-Iraqi, and Abu Jihad ash-Shami, set out to repel them, successively detonating their explosive-laden vehicles on gatherings of the Rafidi army and Popular Mobilization on the outskirts of the town. The attacks resulted in a great massacre, forcing them to retreat in defeat and humiliation. We ask Allah to accept our brothers in the highest levels of Jannah. All praise is due to Allah.
