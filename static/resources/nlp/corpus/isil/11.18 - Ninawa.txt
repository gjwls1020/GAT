Several soldiers of the Khilafah, while seeking Allah's aid, carried out an attack on the Rafidi army and militias occupying parts of the Tahrir neighborhood east of Mosul. Fierce clashes took place during which the murtaddin fled to the outskirts of the neighborhood carrying their killed and wounded. The attack also resulted a headquarters and a hummer of them being destroyed, as well as weaponry and ammunition being taken as ghanimah. All praise is due to Allah.
