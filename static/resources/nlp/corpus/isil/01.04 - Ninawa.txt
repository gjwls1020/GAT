26 Murtaddin Are Killed and Several Vehicles Destroyed in Istishhadi Attacks Towards the East of #Mosul. After relying on Allah, our istishhadi brother Abu 'Abdil-Hakim al-Maslawi (may Allah accept him) set out and detonated his explosive vehicle on groups of #Rafidi soldiers and militias fighters in Sina'at al-Karamah area east of #Mosul. He succeeded in killing 9 murtaddin and wounding others, in addition to destroying 3 Humvees. This was followed by our brothers Abu 'Uthman al-'Iraqi and Abu Muslim al-'Iraqi (may Allah accept them) detonating their explosive vehicles on the gatherings of murtaddin in the Mithaq neighborhood east of the city. The 2 operations resulted in 17 murtaddin being killed and others being wounded, in addition to destroying a base in which they were entrenched, 3 Humvees and an amphibious vehicle, and all praise is due to Allah.
