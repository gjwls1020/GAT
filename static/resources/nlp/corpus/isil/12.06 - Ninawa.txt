5 Istishhadi Operations Strike the Gatherings of the #Rafidi Army and Its Militias Southeast and Northeast of #Mosul. After relying on Allah, our istishhadi brother Abu Khattab al-'Iraqi (may Allah accept him) set out and detonated his explosive vehicle on the #Rafidi soldiers and Militias fighters in the Barid neighborhood northeast of Mosul, destroying an Abrams tank and 2 bulldozers, as well as killing 8 personnel and wounding others. On the other hand, Abu Khattab al-Maslawi, and Ahmad ash-Shami, Abu Salamah ash-Shami and Battar al-Maslawi (may Allah accept them) detonated their explosive vehicles on the gatherings of murtaddin near the Salam hospital southeast of Mosul. They succeeded in killing approximately 35 personnel and destroying 5 BMPs, a bulldozer, a Humvee, as well as disabling several various vehicles. This was followed by clashes during which various types of weapons were employed. The clashes resulted in a Humvee being destroyed and a BMP and 2 Humvees being disabled, in addition to 3 personnel being killed and others being wounded, while a BMP was taken as ghanimah. Battles continue, and we ask Allah for victory and consolidation to his monotheist slaves.
