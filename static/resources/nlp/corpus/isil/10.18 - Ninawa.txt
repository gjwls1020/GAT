Battles remain ongoing for the second consecutive day south and east of Mosul, where the forces of the Islamic State were able today to retake control of the villages of Adalah and Ibrahim Khalil, southeast of the city, which had been captured yesterday by attacking forces. Likewise, Islamic State forces managed to break the cordon imposed by Iraqi forces yesterday on the village of Abbas, east of Mosul, after a flanking maneuver.
