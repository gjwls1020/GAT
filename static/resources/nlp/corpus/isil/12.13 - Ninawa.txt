By Allah's grace, and within the epic battles on the eastern front of Mosul city, the istishhadis Abu Salman at-Tajiki and Abu Khattab as-Sinajri (may Allah accept them) detonated their explosive vehicles amid groups of the Rafidi Army and its militias on the outskirts of the #Intisar neighborhood east of the city. They succeeded in killing 21 murtaddin and wounding others, in addition to destroying 3 BMPs and 3 bases. In the Falah neighborhood northeast of Mosul, a third istishhadi (may Allah accept him) detonated his explosive vehicle on a gathering of Rafidi Army personnel and vehicles, killing approximately 7 murtaddin and wounding a number of others, in addition to destroying a Humvee. Meanwhile, 8 murtaddin were killed by sniper fire on the outskirts of the 'Azizat area southeast of the city, and all praise is due to Allah.
