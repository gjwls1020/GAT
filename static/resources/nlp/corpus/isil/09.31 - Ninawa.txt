By Allah's grace and generosity, and within the heroic epic battes which the soldiers of the Khilafah are engaged in, five of the knights of shahadah (may Allah accept them) managed to advance with their explosive-laden vehicles towards Rafidi Army and militia gatherings near the villages of Farisiyyah, Tall Tayyibah and Azayziyyah, near Shora town. They detonated their vehicles amid the murtaddin groups, resulting in dozens of killed and wounded, while the battles continue.
